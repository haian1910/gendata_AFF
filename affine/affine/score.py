"""Frozen production scoring rule: min(R, G) v5 — centered Reason + banded
Grounding (2026-08-27, weight_version_key=10).

Shared between root validator and eval server. Any change here is a chain fork
(bump [subnet].weight_version_key).

v6 additions (2026-09-04, operator directive; both OFF until the contract
flips them — score_mode="min_rga" and forfeit_turn_score set in [duel]):
  A leg:      b_i = lpC(y_A | z_C^i) − lpC(y_A | ∅)   (per ref, per byte)
              A   = tau·log((1/k)·Σ_i exp(b_i/tau))
              ("would the teacher, thinking its own thought, take the
              miner's action?" — the dual of R; teacher-side only, so no
              lpA surface. NOT centered: centering rewards spread across
              refs, and an action every teacher thought licenses is the
              target, not a flat-lift attack — a generic action earns less
              lift than the right one, unlike filler in the thought.)
  Per turn:   turn = min(R, G, A)                     (score_mode="min_rga")
  Forfeit:    a turn where a side emits no parseable action scores
              forfeit_turn_score (a constant floor) instead of being dropped
              from pairing. Both sides forfeit → both get the floor → tie
              (diff 0, kept in n). Under the old rule a forfeit cost nothing
              and let a miner choose which turns enter its own mean.
              Calibration (40 live min(R,G) duels, 100k valid turns): p1 of
              valid turn scores = −0.087, p5 = −0.041; live forfeit rates
              1.7% median / 5.7% max per side. −0.1 sits under p1, so
              forfeiting beats answering on <1% of turns (unpredictable
              ones) and a 2% forfeit rate costs one δ of margin.

v5 (score_mode="min_rg", the live rule):
  Per ref i:  a_i = lpC(y_i | z_A) − lpC(y_i | ∅)      (per-byte, k refs/turn)
  R leg:      R   = tau·log((1/k)·Σ_i exp(a_i/tau)) − mean_i a_i
              (centered tempered Reason: flat reference-independent lift
              cancels; only committing to a specific teacher mode pays)
  G leg:      m = lpC(z_A | x),  t_i = lpC(z_C^i | x)
              G = min(m − (mu − w), (mu + w) − m)
              with mu = mean(t_i), w = max(band_c·stdev(t_i), band_floor)
              (thought must sit in the likelihood band of the teacher's own
              thoughts: filler falls below, parroting/copying rises above)
  Per turn:   turn = min(R, G)
  Per miner:  score = mean(turn) over turns
  Duel:       challenger wins iff
              paired mean(turn_c − turn_k) > max(k_sigma · SE, min_margin)
              AND median(len(z_A.strip())) ≥ min_thought_chars
              AND (if causality_gamma > 0) B pass rate ≥ causality_gamma
              with SE = stdev(diffs) / sqrt(n) over paired turns.

Why v5 (2026-08-27): the wvk-9 king crowned on a constant filler suffix — a
flat, task-independent lift that raises every a_i equally and benches 0/50
on coding. Centering zeroes that channel by construction; the grounding band
makes content-free or copied thoughts unprofitable. Validated adversarially
(suffix/parrot/boilerplate attacks, GRPO direct optimization: all fail) and
positively (held-out teacher thoughts win at z=+2.56 where v4 was blind at
z=+0.11). Full evidence: research/results/minrg_round2/FINDINGS.txt and
research/docs/MIN_RG_PROPOSAL.md.

History — Reason v4, tempered multi-sample (2026-08-17, wvk 7-9;
score_mode="reason", the replay path for pre-fork verdicts):
  Per turn:   Reason = tau · log( (1/k) · Σ_i exp(a_i / tau) )
  Per miner:  score  = mean(turn Reason) over turns
  Same duel gates.

Scoring hyperparameters: n_turns, k_sigma, min_margin (δ), tau,
n_teacher_samples (k), min_thought_chars, and the B license
(causality_gamma). There is no mix, no clip, and no lpA gates.

Why tempered (v4, 2026-08-17): the teacher's action distribution is
multi-modal — resampling a turn yields different, equally valid actions.
Averaging per-ref Reason in log space punishes a miss without bound, so a
thought that commits to one valid mode has negative expected score whenever
the reference lands on another mode (measured: the teacher's own thought,
unpaired from its rollout, scores ≈ −0.010/byte, n=509). The equilibrium
under that rule is non-committal filler. The tempered log-mean-exp is
dominated by the best-matched reference instead of the worst: a missed mode
zeroes its own share but cannot drag the turn below the credit from a hit,
so committing to the teacher's dominant next action becomes the optimum.
k=1 reduces to the v3 per-pair Reason exactly (any tau); tau→∞ recovers the
plain mean. tau = 0.03 calibrated externally (AIIan, n=100 turns): the flip
from hedge-wins to commit-wins happens near tau=0.1 and is decisive by 0.03,
while cold tau amplifies mode-guessing/leakage — both monitored via
telemetry. min_margin = 0.002 is provisional at the new score scale and is
recalibrated from the first ~20 live v4 duels.

The length floor (2026-08-13, weight_version_key=5) evicts empty /
cue-thought kings. Teacher-side B (2026-08-13, weight_version_key=6) is the
license to play: thoughts must cause the miner's own action as judged by the
teacher. Live dueling.py passes causality_gamma from toml when
causality_gate is on.

δ (min_margin = 0.002, added 2026-08-12, weight_version_key=4) exists for one
reason: the z-test is relative to the challenger's own noise, so an ε-copy of
the king (per-duel SE ≈ 0.0003, ~6× below a distinct model's) crowns at the
same 1-in-44 as anyone else on ±0.0006 noise margins. The absolute floor makes
that ~z=6.7 (≈1-in-7.6e10) while staying below the live 2·SE bar (~0.0035),
so honest duels never touch it. It also caps SE-compression strategies: the
crown bar never drops below δ no matter how consistent a challenger's thoughts
are. Calibration: research/results/delta_calibration.{json,txt}.

Reason (formerly Λ2) is computed entirely on the teacher side: it asks how much
the miner's thought z_A raises the frozen teacher's likelihood of reproducing
its own action y_C. The miner's weights never touch the ranked quantity, which
retires the whole lpA attack surface (RT-3 family: lm_head sharpening,
water-filling, empty-baseline sabotage).

Everything the retired S* v2 gates measured is still computed and published as
TELEMETRY — recorded for study and monitoring, never affecting score or
validity:
  - causality/leakage pass rate  (τ/fuzzy are telemetry constants, not
    consensus knobs)
  - prior-bank positivity frac   (bank_frac; watched for adaptive paraphrase
    priors, which tie genesis on raw Reason but must still beat the sitting
    king at k_sigma·SE)
  - calibration ratio r and empty-baseline magnitude (lpA channel diagnostics)
  - raw L1lift mean (unclipped — safe to publish now that it is not scored)
  - η (eta): sufficiency fraction Λ2(z_A)/Λ2(z_C) — how much of the teacher's
    own thinking the miner's thought replaces (needs lpC(y_C|z_C) from refs)
  - thought/action character lengths (miner-vs-teacher length deltas are
    assembled in evalsrv where teacher refs are in scope)

History: S* v2 (mix + 5 gates + δ floor) was retired 2026-08-10. Raw Λ2
correlates with swe-rebench as well as the mix did on the Albedo panel
(+0.847@15 vs +0.844); the L1 term and its defensive gates were complexity
without signal. The A11 short-style objection to Λ2-only ranking was already
policy-dead (2026-08-05: same-tier S winners may crown). Pre-fork verdicts
stamp the old formula and remain replayable under their stored `gates` block.
